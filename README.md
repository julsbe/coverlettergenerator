# coverlettergenerator
User Interface for Console Application:

Implement a simple text-based user interface where students can input their internship interests and upload their CV.
Topics: Basic Python syntax, I/O operations.
Data Collection and Storage:

Gather inputs from the user, such as internship interests and the file path of their CV.
Topics: String manipulation, file I/O.
Integration with OpenAI API:

Develop a function to interact with the OpenAI API for generating the cover letter.
Topics: API interactions, possibly using the requests module if covered in your course.
Parsing and Preparing Data for the API:

Extract relevant information from the studentâ€™s CV and internship interests to use as input for the API.
Topics: File parsing, string manipulation, possibly regular expressions.
Generating the Cover Letter:

Use the OpenAI API to generate a cover letter based on the provided data.
Topics: API usage, handling JSON responses.
Error Handling and User Feedback:

Implement error handling for API interactions, file operations, and user input validation.
Topics: Exception handling, user input validation.
Testing and Debugging:

Write test cases for your functions, especially for data parsing and API interactions.
Topics: Unit testing (if covered).
